<Description>The mod is a very simple immersion/realism fix. There are two main changes. Firstly, the game is altered such crafting items requires a full forge (an anvil by itself is not sufficient). Secondly, the use of smithing apparatus now requires the necessary tools (hammer, tongs and shovel). Lofgren (on the Nexus Mods forum) provided substantial help in improving the second feature.</Description>
